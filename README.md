# MIS-360-Project
This project involved the creation of a new CRM system for a Broadway Caf√©; a coffee shop that has been open since the 1950s without a computer system. To Improve the cafe's efficiency, we decided to design a new technology system that helps increase customer interaction. 
<br>For this project, we used Microsoft Visio to design the new and innovative CRM system, creating activity diagrams, use-case diagrams, class diagrams, and windows navigation diagrams.
